# loyalty-frontend

Because I am completly reworking the backend in a new language I decided to also rework the frontend but using Vue3 with Vite instead of Vue2.
Here is a link to the backend descriping the currente features and upcomming ones: [Loyalty-Backend](https://github.com/Borsche/Loyalty_Backend)

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
